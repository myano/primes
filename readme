/-----factorization.py-----/

Takes an input 'k' and produces the Prime-Factorization in the form of 
a list, excluding the number one and the given number. 'j' in this file
is a counter for the 'j'th prime number. If you like this in a pretty print
format I have made a for loop inside "numlist_prime.py" which turns the list
into "a * b * c" etc...

The algorithm for this file was also developed by Michael Yanovich. I have
thoroughly commented this file to explain my algorithm and how it works.

/-----generateprimes.py-----/

This program generates the 'n'th prime number. At the moment it is using
a very inefficient method to find the 'n'th prime number. It is basically
counting each prime number from the first prime number until it arrives at
the prime number the user has request. It would most likely be optimal to
implement the pi function (more information here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_counting_function ). 

/-----Is_Prime.py-----/

Takes a given number 'p' and determines whether or not it is prime. 
It uses an algorithm that I ( Michael Yanovich ) developed to
determine whether or not a number is prime. 

/-----list_of_primes.py-----/

It generates a 'list' of prime number up to the given inputted number.
This file imports Is_Prime

/-----numlist_prime.py-----/

It generates the prime factorization into a pretty print format
and also displays the number it is displaying the factorization for.
It displays all the numbers up to the number inputted.

There are more files than listed above, however I have not mentioned those
files because they are used in trying to derive to conclude better formulas
for the above files.
